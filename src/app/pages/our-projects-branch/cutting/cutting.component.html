          Meet my friend Chase, who has one of the most incredible success
          stories I have EVER seen. After graduating college, Saint took a desk
          job as a computer programmer and watched as his weight slowly started

          years, he was able to slowly and steadily bring that down before
          having an incredible breakthrough that allowed him to transform
          drastically. Here’s how he did it.
